# Answering-Business-Questions-Using-SQL

### **Context and objective:**
In this project, we'll be working with a database called The Chinook database in order to answer some business questions.
The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs and albums from a music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables. 

A schema diagram is shown below to help us understand the available columns and the structure of the data.
